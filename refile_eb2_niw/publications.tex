While some of Mr Joshi's publications appear in journals with limited impact metrics, they have nonetheless been widely downloaded, shared, and successfully referenced by peers, demonstrating meaningful contributions to the field. It is important to note that these works were produced alongside full-time industry positions, making direct comparisons with full-time academic research impractical. Furthermore, many of these publications emphasize applied and industry-relevant solutions rather than purely theoretical studies, highlighting their practical significance and influence on real-world applications.


The independent validation of these publications has been confirmed through their indexing and discoverability on widely recognized scholarly platforms such as Google Scholar, Scilit, and through Digital Object Identifier (DOI) registration. This ensures that the articles are verifiable in reputable databases and accessible to the broader research community. Such validation demonstrates that the publications meet professional standards of dissemination and indexing, and they can be presented as credible evidence of scholarly contribution. The following post-decision publications, all peer-reviewed and independently verifiable, are provided for consideration:
