\noindent\textbf{USCIS Policy Manual Guidance.} According to the USCIS Policy Manual Vol. 6, Part F, Chapter 5, to meet the first prong of the Dhanasar framework, "petitioners must show that the person’s proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance." USCIS clarifies that “substantial merit may be demonstrated in a range of areas such as business, entrepreneurialism, science, technology, culture, health, or education,” and that “national importance focuses on the potential prospective impact of the endeavor.” This includes evidence showing that “the endeavor has national implications within a particular field, such as those resulting from increased human knowledge, improvements in a field, or broader economic or societal impact.”\footnote{\url{https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5}}


Mr. Joshi’s, (the applicant) research and applied work in 	\textbf{Generative AI, Big Data, HPC (high perf computing) for financial risk modeling, workforce development and adoption strategies for US Competitiveness} directly address critical gaps in U.S. financial infrastructure and AI up-skilling initiatives. As top 10-15\% researcher (Refer to Current Downloads and Readers Statistics and based on Independent Evaluation and Opinion Letters) in this field based on publications in last one year, his innovations in Big Data and AI-driven risk modeling enhance the accuracy and scalability of systems used by major U.S. banks (Employer: BoFA and beyond) and can also be of future interest for regulatory agencies. 



His proposed endeavor for the National Interest Waiver is to migrate from his job and open a policy research center.
 He plans to leverage his decade of experience, including his critical role as Assistant Vice President in Global Risk Analytics at the Bank, to significantly advance the knowledge base of cutting-edge technologies like Generative AI, Big Data, HPC, Devops, Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC), and High-Performance Computing (HPC) for enhancing the integrity and resilience of the U.S. financial system. \textbf{	See Expert Opinion by Dr Asif Exhibit~\ref{chap:exhibit_asif} and 
	also Expert Opinion by Dr Anjum Exhibit~\ref{chap:exhibit_anjum}
	for details on feasibility of the proposed endeavor projections.}



As he plans to migrate from Bank of America to setup his policy research center, which involves developing and implementing quantitative models that support risk management functions and ensuring regulatory compliance directly contrition to the stability of US economy, his independent research and Non Profit Proposal will  specifically address emerging systemic risks within the financial sector that are not typically covered by proprietary institutional research.


 This will involve publishing peer-reviewed research in prominent financial journals, focusing on innovations in financial risk modeling, machine learning, and big data applications addressing the US Systems.
Simultaneously, Mr Joshi (the applicant) wants to expand his educational initiatives by creating open a Non-Profit educational resources, such as tutorials and workshops, to empower a broader U.S. workforce, including veterans, with practical knowledge in advanced financial analysis and data science, directly supporting national economic goals and fostering job creation in critical technological domains. 		\textbf{		See Expert Opinion Dr Malik Exhibit~\ref{chap:exhibit_malik}. Dr. Rozeria Exhibit~\ref{chap:rozeia} for details validating current research metrics and publications by Independent Expert. Furthermore, mapping of Mr Joshi's work with each Prongs by Dr Sheraz Exhibit\ref{chap:sheraz}	}.  The independent evaluation include validation of DOI/CrossRef/Citation and opinion about Mr Joshi's (Applicant) work.



This integrated approach ensures his contributions have national implications, advancing both the private sector's financial stability through his work at the Bank and the public good through a Non-Profit and as policy research and workforce development expert, thereby transcending the normal expectations of a professional within a single organization (even if we assumes he works in for profit institutions) and providing substantial prospective benefits to the United States beyond any employer's immediate needs refer to Testimonial by Mr Ankit from RBS Exhibit~\ref{chap:exhibit_ankit}.	

We will show how he has already done considerable work toward this en-devour in this document. 	

\textbf{His work is extensively published in peer-reviewed journals and read by peers and industry practitioners}, underscoring its technical rigor and real-world impact as well as contribution to the broader knowledge base in the US. \textbf{Refer to Testimonial LOR from Mr Gaurav Sharma AXA Interntional Insurance} Exhibit~\ref{chap:exhibit_gaurav} about work impact beyond his job at the Bank. 


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Government Documentations about the importance of the field:} The White House's Executive Order on AI (Oct. 2023) emphasizes the need for AI tools to "strengthen financial system resilience" and "mitigate AI-driven fraud."\footnote{Exec. Order No. 14110, 88 Fed. Reg. 75191 (Oct. 30, 2023)} Mr. Joshi's (the applicant) work aligns with these priorities. The White House's Executive Order on AI (Oct. 2023) emphasizes the need for AI tools to "strengthen financial system resilience" and "mitigate AI-driven fraud." Mr. Joshi's work on AI agent frameworks\footnote{Satyadhar Joshi, "Advancing Innovation and Financial Risk Modeling Through Agentic Generative AI," International Journal of Research and Review, 2025} and financial risk management\footnote{Satyadhar Joshi, "Implementing Gen AI for Increasing Robustness of US Financial and Regulatory System," International Journal of Innovative Research in Engineering and Management, 2024}, published by the applicant directly addresses these priorities. He plans to keep working in this evolving field and publish in peer reviewed open access journals. 
	
	\item \textbf{Economic Impact:} His peer-reviewed paper\footnote{Satyadhar Joshi, "Using Gen AI Agents With GAE and VAE to Enhance Resilience of US Markets," The International Journal of Computational Science, Information Technology and Control Engineering, 2025} demonstrates how AI models enhance market resilience through GANs and VAEs. This work builds upon his earlier findings\footnote{Satyadhar Joshi, "Review of Gen AI Models for Financial Risk Management," International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 2025} about GenAI's applications in financial risk domains. This work can be used by not just his employer but different Banks operating in the US markets.
\end{itemize}
	
	Dr. Rozeria Exhibit~\ref{chap:rozeia} as an independent expert also commented on the utility of the work.






\subsubsection{Evidence of National Importance Achievement through Federal Scientific Indexing}

Mr Joshi's (applicant) three peer-reviewed research publications are indexed in \href{https://www.science.gov}{Science.gov}, the official portal for U.S. government science information. Refer Exhibit\ref{chap:exhibit_sgov}

Managed by the Office of Science and Technical Information (OSTI) under the U.S. Department of Energy, Science.gov indexes research outputs deemed relevant to national priorities and funded or curated by major federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH), NASA, and others.

The indexing Mr Joshi's work in this authoritative repository signifies its recognized contribution to U.S. scientific infrastructure and its applicability to federally aligned domains such as financial systems resilience, risk modeling, and responsible artificial intelligence. These topics are critical to national economic security, and my research directly supports innovation in these domains by providing generative AI-based modeling tools for regulatory and institutional use.

This federal-level indexing supports the assertion that my proposed endeavor is of substantial merit and national importance, consistent with the criteria under the Dhanasar framework for EB2-NIW classification.


\subsubsection{Evidence of National Importance Achievement through BLS Indexing}


Mr Joshi's research article, “Generative AI: Mitigating Workforce and Economic Disruptions While Strategizing Policy Responses for Governments and Companies” (Joshi, 2025, International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology, DOI: 10.48175/IJARSCT-23260), has been recognized and utilized by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in their publication on workforce and AI policy (DOI: 10.21916/mlr.2022.21). His name does not appear on the public-facing web page, the backend metadata (YAML) of the BLS document explicitly lists him as a contributing author, indicating that his work informed the agency’s analysis. This demonstrates that his research has had a tangible impact on U.S. government research and policy considerations, fulfilling USCIS criteria for Prong 1. Refer Exhibit\ref{chap:exhibit_sgov}



\subsubsection*{Independent Verification of Government Citations}

Relevant citations can be independently verified through publicly accessible government sources hosted on official \texttt{.gov} domains. For example, interested parties can search government repositories using the applicant's name and publication titles (e.g., \texttt{site:.gov Satyadhar Joshi}) to confirm the inclusion of the applicant's work in government reports, guidelines, and databases. 



\subsubsection{Projected Impact and Future Work}

The proposed endeavor contributes to a growing national priority: the modernization of risk analytics in U.S. banking systems. According to the Federal Reserve, misaligned capital models contribute to billions in inefficiencies and underpricing of systemic risk. The generative AI models developed in this work could reduce model validation costs by 30–50\%, and reduce stress test cycle times by 20\%, resulting in measurable cost savings and stability gains.

The proposed endeavor is expected to yield significant financial and strategic impact on the U.S. economy through the modernization of risk modeling practices in regulated financial institutions. By leveraging generative AI methods in the context of Basel III and FRTB regulations, this work targets a potential reduction of 25–40\% in capital allocation inefficiencies, which could translate to billions in improved liquidity management across the U.S. banking sector.

Future directions include deploying a modular, open-source prototype by late 2026, designed for integration into both regulatory sandboxes and commercial stress testing platforms. Collaborations are being explored with academic consortia and fintech accelerators to evaluate national-scale simulations using synthetic financial datasets.



Within the next 12–18 months, an open-source prototype will be released to enable scalable risk simulations using synthetic financial data, which can benefit smaller institutions and regulators alike. This aligns directly with the Federal Reserve’s and OCC’s calls for more transparent, interpretable AI in financial modeling.

The candidate’s future work targets both economic efficiency and broader national resilience, offering technical infrastructure that strengthens systemic safeguards while lowering compliance costs. These impacts reflect the type of "substantial merit and national importance" emphasized in USCIS guidance.

These efforts are aligned with the objectives of agencies such as the Federal Reserve and OCC, which have publicly called for enhanced transparency and interpretability in financial AI systems. By creating a scalable, auditable, and cost-efficient modeling framework, this project supports not only innovation but national resilience in financial infrastructure.




\subsection{U.S. Training Initiatives by Open Non-Profit and Research Center}

Mr. Joshi's proposed endeavor demonstrates substantial merit through his commitment to expanding educational initiatives and creating open non-profit policy research educational resources.

\section{Projected Five-Year Endeavor and National Economic Impact}
\label{sec:impact}


Over the next five years, Mr Joshi's dual role as a Vice President at BoFA Sachs and as an independent researcher aims to create a transformative ripple effect in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) across the U.S. financial sector. At the bank, Mr Joshi will develop and implement advanced AI-driven risk models and operational frameworks that are projected to increase banking efficiency and reduce operational costs, thereby enabling banks to offer more affordable and accessible financial services to consumers and businesses. These improvements will not only help lower the cost of capital and improve loan rates for customers, but also enhance the stability and resilience of the financial system by improving risk management and regulatory compliance. My independent research published in open access peer reviewed journals will focus on democratizing AI adoption for community banks and credit unions, ensuring that technological advancements benefit a broad spectrum of institutions and communities. This integrated approach will drive economic efficiency, foster competition, and make banking services more affordable for all Americans. Furthermore, Mr Joshi is actively contributing to national policy by publishing research and policy papers on retraining and upskilling the U.S. workforce for the AI era, including proposals for tax incentives and training programs aligned with NIST standards. Collectively, these initiatives will strengthen the U.S. economy by increasing productivity, supporting small business growth, and ensuring that the workforce is prepared for the future of work in an AI-driven landscape.
