\section*{Clarification on Papers Published}Note: While some of Mr Joshi's publications appear in journals with limited impact metrics, they have nonetheless been widely downloaded, shared, and successfully referenced by peers, demonstrating meaningful contributions to the field. It is important to note that these works were produced alongside full-time industry positions, making direct comparisons with full-time academic research impractical. Furthermore, many of these publications emphasize applied and industry-relevant solutions rather than purely theoretical studies, highlighting their practical significance and influence on real-world applications.


The independent validation of these publications has been confirmed through their indexing and discoverability on widely recognized scholarly platforms such as Google Scholar, Scilit, and through Digital Object Identifier (DOI) registration. This ensures that the articles are verifiable in reputable databases and accessible to the broader research community. Such validation demonstrates that the publications meet professional standards of dissemination and indexing, and they can be presented as credible evidence of scholarly contribution. The following post-decision publications, all peer-reviewed and independently verifiable, are provided for consideration:

\section*{Paper Indexed in BLS .gov}
https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/content/doi/mlr.2022.21.txt

Mr Joshi's research article, “Generative AI: Mitigating Workforce and Economic Disruptions While Strategizing Policy Responses for Governments and Companies” (Joshi, 2025, International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology, DOI: 10.48175/IJARSCT-23260), has been recognized and utilized by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in their publication on workforce and AI policy (DOI: 10.21916/mlr.2022.21). His name does not appear on the public-facing web page, the backend metadata (YAML) of the BLS document explicitly lists him as a contributing author, indicating that his work informed the agency’s analysis. This demonstrates that his research has had a tangible impact on U.S. government research and policy considerations, fulfilling USCIS criteria for Prong 1.

Index Copernicus International (ICI) is a Polish-based platform that indexes scientific journals after they undergo a multi-criteria parametric evaluation. The evaluation considers aspects such as publishing quality, stability, digitalization, and internationalization, among others, resulting in the Index Copernicus Value (ICV), a metric reflecting the journal's quality for a given year. The ICV is widely used in Poland and some European countries as a recognized criterion for assessing scientific publications.

Web of Science (WoS) indexes high-quality peer-reviewed journals across disciplines. Inclusion signifies editorial rigor, research significance, and provides citation metrics widely used to assess scholarly impact.

A lot of Mr Joshi's published research is accessible through the Web of Science™ Research Commons, a globally recognized research discovery platform. So even though some of the journal itself is not listed in the Web of Science Core Collection, the inclusion of his article in Research Commons ensures that it is searchable and retrievable by researchers worldwide through the Web of Science portal. This enhances the visibility and accessibility of his work to the international scientific community and allows for citation tracking when referenced by other works within the Core Collection. The presence of his research on this platform demonstrates its dissemination across a premier academic database and supports its potential to contribute to advancements in the proposed field.

\chapter{Exhibit : Research Commons}
\label{chap:research_commons}

\section*{Research Commons}

The \textit{Web of Science Research Commons} is a global research discovery service that provides open access to scholarly outputs. Unlike the \textit{Web of Science Core Collection}, which indexes selected journals based on strict editorial criteria, Research Commons expands the visibility of academic work by including additional publications and preprints, thereby offering a broader landscape of scholarly communication.

Several of Mr. Joshi’s publications are available in Research Commons. This ensures that his research remains searchable and retrievable worldwide through the Web of Science portal, even in cases where the host journal may not itself be listed in the Core Collection. The inclusion in Research Commons thus enhances visibility, facilitates broader dissemination, and integrates his contributions into recognized citation tracking systems whenever they are referenced by works indexed in the Core Collection.

The presence of Mr. Joshi’s research in Research Commons demonstrates that his work is accessible to the global scientific community, thereby strengthening its potential impact in advancing the proposed field.
